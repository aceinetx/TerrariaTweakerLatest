# TerrariaTweakerLatest
After a long research I have finnaly found the latest tt2 version. So bad that terraria tweaker 2 died, but it is still secretly being updated<br>
[TT2 Changelogs](https://www.tiberiumfusion.com/product/tt2/res/changelog_tt2.txt) (Latest update was on 2023-07-12)<br>
To be honest I found it a long time ago, and i forgot how to re-download it if terraria 1.4.5 comes out and tt2 would be updated
