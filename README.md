# TerrariaTweakerLatest
After a long research I have finnaly found the latest tt2 version. So bad that terraria tweaker 2 died, but it is still secretly being updated<br>
[TT2 Changelogs](https://www.tiberiumfusion.com/product/tt2/res/changelog_tt2.txt) (Latest update was on 2023-07-12)<br>
To be honest I found it a long time ago, and i forgot how to re-download it if terraria 1.4.5 comes out and tt2 would be updated<br>
App info:
- Version: 2.3.1449.2
- Official release
- TTPlugins version: 1.2.0.1
- Released on July 12, 2023
- TTApplicator version: 1.2.1449.2
<br><br>P.S. while writing it i remembered a way to download it: so you have to download latest TT2 from wayback machine (it will be outdated) and in the app you have to check the version and it will self-update to the latest one
